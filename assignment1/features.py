# We have seen that we can achieve reasonable performance on an image classification task by training a linear classifier on the pixels of the input image. In this exercise we will show that we can improve our classification performance by training linear classifiers not on raw pixels but on features that are computed from the raw pixels.
# 
# All of your work for this exercise will be done in this notebook.

# ## Extract Features
# For each image we will compute a Histogram of Oriented
# Gradients (HOG) as well as a color histogram using the hue channel in HSV
# color space. We form our final feature vector for each image by concatenating
# the HOG and color histogram feature vectors.
# 
# Roughly speaking, HOG should capture the texture of the image while ignoring
# color information, and the color histogram represents the color of the input
# image while ignoring texture. As a result, we expect that using both together
# ought to work better than using either alone. Verifying this assumption would
# be a good thing to try for the bonus section.
# 
# The `hog_feature` and `color_histogram_hsv` functions both operate on a single
# image and return a feature vector for that image. The extract_features
# function takes a set of images and a list of feature functions and evaluates
# each feature function on each image, storing the results in a matrix where
# each column is the concatenation of all feature vectors for a single image.

# ### Inline question 1:
# Describe the misclassification results that you see. Do they make sense?

# ## Neural Network on image features
# Earlier in this assigment we saw that training a two-layer neural network on raw pixels achieved better classification performance than linear classifiers on raw pixels. In this notebook we have seen that linear classifiers on image features outperform linear classifiers on raw pixels. 
# 
# For completeness, we should also try training a neural network on image features. This approach should outperform all previous approaches: you should easily be able to achieve over 55% classification accuracy on the test set; our best model achieves about 60% classification accuracy.

# # Bonus: Design your own features!
# 
# You have seen that simple image features can improve classification performance. So far we have tried HOG and color histograms, but other types of features may be able to achieve even better classification performance.
# 
# For bonus points, design and implement a new type of feature and use it for image classification on CIFAR-10. Explain how your feature works and why you expect it to be useful for image classification. Implement it in this notebook, cross-validate any hyperparameters, and compare its performance to the HOG + Color histogram baseline.

# # Bonus: Do something extra!
# Use the material and code we have presented in this assignment to do something interesting. Was there another question we should have asked? Did any cool ideas pop into your head as you were working on the assignment? This is your chance to show off!
